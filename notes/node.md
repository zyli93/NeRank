# Notes

## Questions need to be solved
1. Too many problems don't have an accepted answer, leading to the problem that nearly half of the answers have not parent question.
    * Tentative solution: choose dataset carefully
    * Treat those non-accepted answers as accepted ones
    * Consider the highest score one as the "accepted answer"

2. Still a lot pf "\\" remains after string cleaning.
